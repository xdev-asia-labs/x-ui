# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in [our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md).

## How to create a changeset

Run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository. This will guide you through creating a changeset for the packages you've modified.

## How to release

1. Create changesets for your changes using `pnpm changeset`
2. Commit your changes along with the changeset file(s)
3. When merged to main, the GitHub Action will:
   - Create a "Version Packages" PR if there are pending changesets
   - When that PR is merged, it will publish to npm automatically
